# Space Sim

## Inspiration

This is a project that I've been working on as a way of better understanding Pixi.js.

## Controls

Click on the ship to show controls.

All 3 buttons, do the same thing (for now): player movement.

### Movement

Click on `move` button followed by where you want the ship to move.

### Attack

TBD

### Patrol (questionable feature)

TBD
